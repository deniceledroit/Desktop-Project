# Web Project - BGInventory
During my studies, I've made a Desktop Application with .NET's Framework (an application for Windows only) following MVC's design pattern. This application deals about a Airsoft gear's company.
## Tasks
This application must have an authentication page for users' company. there is 2 types of users: a manager and an employee. When the user is connected, the possible actions depends of the role, the employee can see, edit and add a product while the manager can do these things with the possibility of defining a price for a product and even desactivate users' account.
